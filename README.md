# Mark This Up

*Mark This Up* is a simple git powered blogging platform. I say git powered, it's just a flatfile blogging platform written in Ruby, using Sinatra. It's aimed to be used with Heroku or another service like that. The code may be a bit shabby. Feel free to fork and contribute :)

## Running the app

    $ bundle install
    $ foreman start
