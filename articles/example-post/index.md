I'm unorganised. Something needs to change, I'm not too sure what it is, but something definitely needs to be done. My note taking is iffy at best and even when it's on form, who knows where I left that brilliantly formed plan of my thoughts. Yes, my organisation is that bad. I often find myself scribbling on scraps of paper (as you do), which are never to be seen by human eyes again. It's an annoying habit that I've developed.

Early this year I read a chapter of *Interface Culture* by *Steven Johnson*, in which it touched ground on the [Memex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex).

>"The memex (a portmanteau of "memory" and "index", like Rolodex an earlier index portmanteau common at the time) is the name given by Vannevar Bush to the hypothetical proto-hypertext system he described in his 1945 The Atlantic Monthly article As We May Think. Bush envisioned the memex as a device in which an individual would compress and store all of their books, records, and communications, "mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility". The memex would provide an "enlarged intimate supplement to one's memory". The concept of the memex influenced the development of early hypertext systems, eventually leading to the creation of the World Wide Web."

The part of the memex that I found particularly interesting was the idea of the *associative trails* it could produce. Bush conceived a way of creating a new linear sequence of microfilm frames and creating a chain of links between them, along with an ability to create personal comments and side trails within an initial trail. The idea was to store data in a way that would mimic the way we associate information within the brain. Basically, it could be able create a trail of your thought processes based on the way you associate each bit of data with one another. Imagine all of the research and ideas for a project, linked together by association and relativity in a way that would be easy to understand.

I need a modern memex. A way of storing data in relation to a project, with a clear trail based on association and relativity within an optional chronological timeline. It's possible I'm sure. There's probably already software out there for it, but nothing that has captured my imagination in the same way that reading about the memex does. In my opinion, for Bush to have conceived this system way back in 1945 and it still be a relevant and interesting is frankly incredible, especially when looking at the rate of development around technology.

Having someway of storing all my thoughts, research, plans, etc in relation to a project would be a game changer and solve all my quarrels with organisation. It would be great to see any projects that have touched on this subject of associative trails, so if you know of any please do share.
