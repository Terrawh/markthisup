It's recently dawned on me that I lack any ability to write something that would interest anyone. Simply put, I can't write well. I know my spelling is terrible and my grammar is worse. But surely those can be overcome using the delightful tools built into any word processor available today. The bigger question is how can I learn to communicate in a way that captivates the reader for longer than one of my usual 140 character tweets? The answer is practice.

Over the duration of the first year of my degree, I officially submitted a grand total of 2000 words and only 1000 of that in a roughly academic format. That is all that was required. Crazy right? Just to clear things up, I'm currently studying BA Graphic Design at Central St Martins in London, England. At the time having so little academic based assignments seemed like a blessing, in hindsight it feels more like a disadvantage. *I want to be able to write well.*

I've been told that a fundamental skill that every designer should posses is being able to communicate clearly and effectively. If you can communicate something well through writing then surely it can only strengthen your ability to design effectively. I've recently begun to read more blog posts by creatives and it seems that some of the best writers are also some of the best and most successful designers, coincidence? Most likely not.

Two posts in particular have inspired me to try to improve my communication and more importantly my writing. The first is [Ten more things](http://blog.frankchimero.com/post/6358013062/ten-more-things) by [Frank Chimero](http://frankchimero.com). As I read over this piece of writing for a second time, I realised that there is nothing particularly profound or immensely valuable to be taken from it, it's lighthearted and intriguing. It's speaks to you in a way that keeps you wanting to read more. It's well written; it's clear, to the point and you can understand what he was thinking as he wrote it. I want that skill.

The second post that has driven me to attempt writing more is [I want to write more](http://maxvoltar.com/archive/i-want-to-write-more) by [Tim van Damme](http://timvandamme.com/). His recent lack of writing spurred him to blame his lack of writing on everything he could think of, before admitting it was just down to himself. He tied blaming his blog's design with deconstructing the blog's design leaving only the default html stylings. Makes for a more genuine read in my own opinion, nice touch. It's an interesting bit of self criticism, showing that even some of the most popular designers out there aren't always one shot killers.

So it’s the design, why else can’t I seem to maintain this blog? I need to redesign this thing, that’ll solve everything and allow me to write more. I want to write more."

Let's be honest. You've probably drifted off and/or given up the will to live by now. Last thing now, I promise.

Why a blog? Why not just write. Simple really, if I'm crap people can tell me and it gives me more motivation if I put something out there. Having a text document lying around on my desktop isn't really going to help too much, what's the point of writing if no-ones going to read it? The name  [Themboldtypes](http://themboldtypes.com) comes purely from a domain that I wasn't using, so made sense to do something with it. The blog is a simple [Symphony](http://symphony-cms.com) build and if you would like a copy to run for yourself just ask.
