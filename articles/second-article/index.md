# What is design. //
- The first project of the year.
- What is design?
- Had to shake of the holiday and my initial responses were pretty sarcastic. //
- Realised I wanted an honest response. //
- Early experience with graphic design. Mixed media experiments.
- Tried to capture this with my piece.
- Artistic material and real world stains to explore idea design is a mixture of art and real world experience.//

# Conceptual Drawing.
- Try to capture the idea of conflict. Emphasise on content not skill.
- Decided early on that wanted entire thing to be conceptual. //
- Process Art. Process art is concerned with the actual doing; art as a rite, ritual, and performance. Richard Serra, Molten lead.
- Wanted the way the piece was drawn to mean something. //
- Drawn on cheap paper, with leaves ripped from a tree. Mans power over nature.
- Way paper wrinkled and the randomness of the drips is nature fighting back.
- Leaf symbolises nature and the tree killer axe re enforces conflict.
- Happy with final outcome as it's not a piece I would normally do.

# Penrose

- Had to create a catalogue entry for a Penrose annual.
- Decided to modernise and create a website. //
- First mock up, tried to add information into the navigational
elements of the website.
- Timeline.
- Percentage bar buttons. //
- Final design uses more sympathetic colours and type.
- Percentage bars have been revamped and are subtler.
- Couldn't make the timeline slider work as javascript skills aren't that good.

# Roll up.
- We created 14 interventions to raise awareness of SOPA. An act that would censor the internet as we know it.
- We joined in a global protest by carrying out 14 interventions in one day.
- Tried to annoy and inconvience people like the law would do if passed.
- Good examples were the mouse stickers and ethernet tags that disconnected peoples interent.
- We had a few scares when the bill got withdrawn, leaving us without a story but it came back stronger than before.
- We responded to events as they happened, such as the RIAA sueing someone for the maximum amount of money.
- Work is presented in a blog format to tie them together.

# Webtypo

- Speaking of websites, here my web typo.
- Any questions?
